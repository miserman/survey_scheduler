<img src='docs/icon.png' width='200px'>

## services
The app uses these Amazon services:
* [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/): To manage user accounts.
* [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/): To store study information and participant details.
* [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/): To send the SMS messages.

## demo
The [demo study](https://miserman.github.io/survey_scheduler/?study=demo) is a disintegrated version of the interface, which can be used for testing.

Participants can be added to the demo study individually through the add or edit menu, or automatically generated by specifying an **n** parameter in the URL; e.g., [miserman.github.io/survey_scheduler/?study=demo&**n=50**](https://miserman.github.io/survey_scheduler/?study=demo&n=50).
